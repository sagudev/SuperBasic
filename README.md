## Features

* Supports running local BASIC programs
* Supports fetching and running classic BASIC games from the Internet

The programs that superbasic can fetch are located at the [Vintage Basic](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html) web site.
Thanks to Lyle Kopnicky for the scanning and hosting these classic programs.

For example:
```
% sb play hammurabi
                               HAMURABI
              CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY



TRY YOUR HAND AT GOVERNING ANCIENT SUMERIA
FOR A TEN-YEAR TERM OF OFFICE.



HAMURABI:  I BEG TO REPORT TO YOU,
IN YEAR 1 , 0 PEOPLE STARVED, 5 CAME TO THE CITY,
POPULATION IS NOW 100
THE CITY NOW OWNS  1000 ACRES.
YOU HARVESTED 3 BUSHELS PER ACRE.
THE RATS ATE 200 BUSHELS.
YOU NOW HAVE  2800 BUSHELS IN STORE.

LAND IS TRADING AT 21 BUSHELS PER ACRE.
HOW MANY ACRES DO YOU WISH TO BUY?

```

You can see a full list of the known games by issuing the `sb list` command.
